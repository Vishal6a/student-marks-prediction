# 📘 Student Marks Prediction

A beginner-friendly machine learning project using Linear Regression to predict student scores based on hours studied.

## 📌 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 📈 Problem Statement
Given the number of hours a student studies, predict the score using a regression model.

## 💡 What I Learned
- Data visualization
- Training-test split
- Regression modeling
- Error evaluation (MAE)

## 🧠 Prediction Example
If a student studies 7 hours, the predicted score is approximately **70+**.
